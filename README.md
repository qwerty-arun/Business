## How to start a Business with NO money?
- You don't start with original idea, you start with what you like doing. </br>
- Idea: Find a partner. Ex:- If you like writing, write and find someone who can publish it for you (like an agent). <br>
- Execution: Social Media, Blogs, Podcasts etc. </br>
- Revenue: Experimenting with different ways to make money from the thing that you're doing. Ex: Hourly charges v/s outcome based charges etc. </br>
- Purpose:- Find a purpose bigger than yourself. START WITH WHY! "You won't have to manage people because you only have to manage purpose". </br>

## How to WIN?
- Delayed Gratification </br>
- Culture in the company should be client centric. Should bring value. </br>
- LUCK: 1) Be persistent: Define what is success for you. 2) Taking risks. </br>

## How to LOSE?
- Don't let things own you! </br>
- Let short term ego go. Look like a loser. Let people underestimate you! Embrace failure! 'A' students are scared to lose! </br>
- Don't go drive a fancy car impressing people who don't know you! Be YOU! </br>
- Take your time. Don't let other decide that you are a loser. </br>

## How to make a Mind Map?
- Find out what you love to do: your interests, your hobbies etc. Write down what businesses you can build around it. </br>
- Think about how to network. It may be through podcasts or what ever. </br>
- In your early days, try to build a website for your company so that people around the world have easy access to it. Apps are not easy! </br>
- Write down what team will you be needing. Ex: Editor, Accountant etc. </br>
- Think about how you can grow your company even more. Like merchandise for example. </br>

## How to find Purpose?
- Think about it. Most don't! </br>
- What problem matters to you and Why? Try to come up with a solution. It can be the simplest. </br>
- Matching what you do in your day and your actual purpose is very important. </br>
- 1+1=11 Team up! </br>

## How to find a Co-Founder? 
- Hate/Love Be Clear!
- Same moral code. But how to put to test:- 40 yrs of crazy lifestyle then bad reputation. Be careful with ppl who say 'YES' to this.
- Post it on Social Media etc.

## How to Sell?
- Sell the sizzle, not the steak! Sell the meaning. Have a purpose. PEOPLE DON'T BUY WHAT YOU DO BUT WHY YOU DO IT! For example: In big events, Steve Jobs connects to so called 'techies' and he sells to them. Then the techies sell to others and so on. The techies are on the left side of the "Law of Diffusion Curve" and are known by "early adopters" . Without convincing these people why you do it, you can't target the middle part of the curve. Your product won't sell. 
- Understand your customer: Do they need you? Do you like them? Deal!
- Making contact at least once a month with the big companies you want to work with in the future. For example, Simon himself sent wishes, important research papers to big companies which he wanted to work with. It will take months to make a deal with them, sometimes even years.

## How to Market? 
- Who your customer is?
- Create a tool which symbolises your WHY. For example, Simon brought a staircase.
- This tool attracts media.
- System: Email (database system), Social Media, PR, branding, events etc.
- HAVE FUN!

## How to PR your business? 
- Targeting PR in the local area in which you live in will help.
- Journalists are lazy! Provide them with everything you can. Research about them too: what they write about, what are their interests and their style of writing.
- Twitter is really good platform to get hold of journalists. Engage with their posts. Else you can find their contace details in newspapers or even google.
- Learn to be disciplined. Learn to be a brand. Respect is everything.

## How to get an Investor?
- Family and friends. Although rare, it works the best as you know the person well. You should warn them that they could lose it all. Don't oversell!
- Look at your team members as potential investors.
- Angel investors: Don't ask for money, ask for help. Create a FOMO environment and again, don't oversell.
- Venture Capitalists: Identify how they got money, see who they invested in before, connect to a previous company that the VC has invested in.
- Work with your brand partner or client to fund your growth (sometimes your client who wants your service or the brand that's sponsoring you will pay for your expansion).
- Make sure you need the money. Sometimes all you might need is better sales. Just go to crowdfunding sites.

## How to get sponsors?
- Value Return (views or sales).
- Emotional Sale.
- Understand the brand value: how they traditionally advertise.
- People in the brands, connect with them.
- Work with someone already working with one of these brands. Agents: media buyers and agencies.
- Lean into a brand relationship. Use their brands to get into their culture.
