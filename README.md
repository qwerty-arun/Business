## How to start a Business with NO money?
- You don't start with original idea, you start with what you like doing. </br>
- Idea: Find a partner. Ex:- If you like writing, write and find someone who can publish it for you (like an agent). <br>
- Execution: Social Media, Blogs, Podcasts etc. </br>
- Revenue: Experimenting with different ways to make money from the thing that you're doing. Ex: Hourly charges v/s outcome based charges etc. </br>
- Purpose:- Find a purpose bigger than yourself. START WITH WHY! "You won't have to manage people because you only have to manage purpose". </br>

## How to WIN?
- Delayed Gratification </br>
- Culture in the company should be client centric. Should bring value. </br>
- LUCK: 1) Be persistent: Define what is success for you. 2) Taking risks. </br>

## How to LOSE?
- Don't let things own you! </br>
- Let short term ego go. Look like a loser. Let people underestimate you! Embrace failure! 'A' students are scared to lose! </br>
- Don't go drive a fancy car impressing people who don't know you! Be YOU! </br>
- Take your time. Don't let other decide that you are a loser. </br>

## How to make a Mind Map?
- Find out what you love to do: your interests, your hobbies etc. Write down what businesses you can build around it. </br>
- Think about how to network. It may be through podcasts or what ever. </br>
- In your early days, try to build a website for your company so that people around the world have easy access to it. Apps are not easy! </br>

## How to find a Co-Founder? 
- Hate/Love Be Clear!
- Same moral code. But how to put to test:- 40 yrs of crazy lifestyle then bad reputation. Be careful with ppl who say 'YES' to this.
- Post it on Social Media etc.

## How to Sell?
- Sell the sizzle, not the steak! Sell the meaning. Have a purpose. PEOPLE DON'T BUY WHAT YOU DO BUT WHY YOU DO IT! For example: In big events, Steve Jobs connects to so called 'techies' and he sells to them. Then the techies sell to others and so on. The techies are on the left side of the "Law of Diffusion Curve" and are known by "early adopters" . Without convincing these people why you do it, you can't target the middle part of the curve. Your product won't sell. 
- Understand your customer: Do they need you? Do you like them? Deal!
- Making contact at least once a month with the big companies you want to work with in the future. For example, Simon himself sent wishes, important research papers to big companies which he wanted to work with. It will take months to make a deal with them, sometimes even years.

## How to Market? 
- Who your customer is?
- Create a tool which symbolises your WHY. For example, Simon brought a staircase.
- This tool attracts media.
- System: Email (database system), Social Media, PR, branding, events etc.
- HAVE FUN!

## How to PR your business? 
- Targeting PR in the local area in which you live in will help.
- Journalists are lazy! Provide them with everything you can. Research about them too: what they write about, what are their interests and their style of writing.
- Twitter is really good platform to get hold of journalists. Engage with their posts. Else you can find their contace details in newspapers or even google.
- Learn to be disciplined. Learn to be a brand. Respect is everything.

## How to get an Investor?
- Family and friends. Although rare, it works the best as you know the person well. You should warn them that they could lose it all. Don't oversell!
- Look at your team members as potential investors.
- Angel investors: Don't ask for money, ask for help. Create a FOMO environment and again, don't oversell.
- Venture Capitalists: Identify how they got money, see who they invested in before, connect to a previous company that the VC has invested in.
- Work with your brand partner or client to fund your growth (sometimes your client who wants your service or the brand that's sponsoring you will pay for your expansion).
- Make sure you need the money. Sometimes all you might need is better sales. Just go to crowdfunding sites.

## How to get sponsors?
- Value Return (views or sales).
- Emotional Sale.
- Understand the brand value: how they traditionally advertise.
- People in the brands, connect with them.
- Work with someone already working with one of these brands. Agents: media buyers and agencies.
- Lean into a brand relationship. Use their brands to get into their culture. 

## How to build a brand?
- What are your values and what do you care about?
- Your brand will have its own personal branding.
- References:- Nike supports top performing atheletes. Risks involved.
- Leadership:- You personally leading the company, you need to have proper mechanisms to make sure you're protected as a brand. Risks involved.
- You should have a strong transition plan.
- Learn to say NO.

## How to Hire, Grow and Build?
- Purpose:- People you hire believe in that purpose, you'll never have to manage anybody. One way is to check their social media.
- Give your team equity. Is a token of respect.
- Value that your business holds and you need people to grow.
- Destination:- Why you do you wanna grow?
- Risks:- Make sure you build minimal viable products.
- Allow people to be speacialists in certain areas. In early days, you might need them to ge generalists. For this, you need proper systems.

## How to Fire Someone?
- Put a proper structure in place to identify what is success for that employee. You haven't performed -> How can I help you perfom?
- 7 and 8 rule: they are hard to manage. Help them if needed.
- If they come up too much in any conversation, you have a problem.
- Fearful of not finding someone better. Line up next hire before you fire. Help them find that 'other' job they are looking for.

## How to go Global?
- Research for opportunity. Find out where your product could be sold:- Investro, partership with a brand etc.
- Franchising: Someone else running your brand in another Market under a License.

## How to get a Mentor?
- Research what matters to that person.
- Defint what you mean when you say "Will you be my mentor?".
- Ask a question firest instead of mentorship. The latter will result in no reply.
- Mentor <-> Advisor. Advisory board of a Company usually exists.
- Connect to the people that they are connected to (referals).
- Give value, don't expect anything.

# How Equity Works?
- "You control your company by the shareholder agreement not by the amount of equity that you hold. Equity ownership != Control.
- Don't sell too much equity in the beginning. 50/50 if you have a co-founder. But the danger is decision lock.
- Or you could do 50/50 with the board of advisors. You need to know where you are going and why and therefore avoid conflict when it comes to major decision making. For example: one person wants to take the money out and other wants to put it back into business.
- If you are a Ltd company looking to raise money, please make your cap table has the right people on it. Ex: ownership will tarnish your reputation. Align your brand to the equity ownership.
- Shares: On the stock market, you own but don't have infuence over that business, no decision making power. A company can delist itself from stock market.
- Give real life equity to your staff.
- Research about shares and equity, it is a vast topic.
- If you are looking to list it on IPO one day, you need to know that when you're starting the business. Reverse engineer your share equity structure from your end goal.
- Safe concept: What is your business worth?

# How to Sell your business? 
- Build a business you love and sell it by accident, by this you actually make a lot of money.
- Partner itself buys.
- You can approach agents.
- Merger (with competition). This comes with risks.
- Allowing the management itself to buy.
- "Never start a business to sell it".
